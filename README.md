# About the project

Numbers are everywhere and play an important role in society! In this JavaScript counter project a value is shown on the custom HTML page and this value will increase by 1 when we click on the " + " button and decrease by 1 when we click on the " â€“ " button.

This second project as a full stack development student was fun to build indeed.

## Built with:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

### Usage

* Click on the "+" button to increment the value of the counter.
* Click on the "-" button to decrement the value of the counter.

* If the count goes below 0, the number should change to the color blue.
